    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we focus on the relationship between round-trip-time and distance, in an attempt to characterize and quantify the *geoprivacy risk* associated with a given collection of RTT data; in other words, the probability that said data could be used to produce or refine an estimate of the location of an Internet endpoint with unknown location, and the maximum resolution of that estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we reconsider the problem of using Internet latency measurements for geolocation, but consider this problem to be the *attacker's* problem. This problem has been well-considered in the literature: *[EDITOR'S NOTE: link citations from the PAM paper here]*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology assumes that our input is access to RTT data between an endpoint with a known location, and an endpoint with an unknown location, and our output is an estimate of the location of the unknown endpoint. This would be the case, for example with passively-measured RTT between an access network and a content-delivery network, for example, where the location of the particular CDN endpoint can be assumed to reasonably high resolution given an understanding of how the CDN distributes and assigns names and addresses to its front-end servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful approach to geolocation from latency measurements is *exclusion*: given a measurements from a known point toward an unknown point, the unknown point cannot be outside a sphere of radius $r$ equal to the distance given by the [second equation](#eq-dist) above. Taking a series of RTT measurements, and taking the minimum of these to minimize $D_{queue}$ and $D_{proc}$ in each direction, gives \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    r < kc\\frac{min(RTT_n)}{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "(where $\\frac{RTT}{2}$ represents the maximum one-way delay a given RTT can represent).\n",
    "\n",
    "By intersecting the spheres around multiple known points, then intersecting that intersected volume with the surface of the Earth, where most endpoints are presumed to be, the region within which the unknown endpoint can be narrowed down.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the utility of RTT data for this methodology, we need a source of RTT data covering a relatively diverse set of Internet paths where the locations of both endpoints are known with some precision; we turn to [RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net) for this data."
